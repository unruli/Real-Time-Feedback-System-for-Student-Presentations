## üé≠ Emotion Detection in Voice

The system includes an emotion detection module that analyzes vocal tone to identify emotional states such as:

- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Neutral

We currently support models like:

- **SpeechBrain**: `speechbrain/emotion-recognition-wav2vec2-IEMOCAP`
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: `audeering/wav2vec2-large-robust-12-ft-emotion`

These models allow real-time emotion recognition from audio input, offering students deeper insight into how their tone may influence presentation delivery.
